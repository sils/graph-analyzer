This is a simple graph analyzer. It is written for academical purposes and is
NOT an example for good programming style or such a thing.

Its GPL3, so its free to use, modify and distribute but the copyright stays.

As you might have guessed you can execute the analyzer with
./analyze.py

The help will show you whats needed.
